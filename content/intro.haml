%h2 What is a Script?

%p
  StackFu scripts are composed of four different components: controls, requirements, 
  executions and validations. One script is represented by a folder on the file system 
  containing YAML and ERB files.

%p
  Each script has a script.yml descriptor and two subfolders: config and executables. 
  The config folder contains four configuration files: 01-controls.yml, 02-requirements.yml, 
  03-executions.yml and 04-validations.yml.

%p 
  Here's a typical folder tree for a script:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      my_script/
        script.yml
        config/
          01-controls.yml
          02-requirements.yml
          03-executions.yml
          04-validations.yml
        executables/
          install_my_script.sh.erb

%h2 The script descriptor

%p
  The file script.yml describes your script. It has attributes like name, description and tags. Here's an example:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ---
      type: script
      name: my_script
      description: Sets up my Ubuntu environment
      tags: [dotfiles, ubuntu]

%h2 Attributes in script.yml
