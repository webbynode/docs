%h2 MySQL Remote Access

%p
  By default remote access to MySQL database server is disabled for security reasons. However, some time you need to provide remote access to database server from home or a web server. If you want to remotely access to the database server from the web server or home, follow this quick tutorial.

%h3 Enabling MySQL Remote Access

%p
  You need type the following commands which will allow remote connections.

%h4 Step 1 - Login using SSH

%p
  Login over ssh to remote MySQL database server:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      ssh root@your-server-ip

%h4 Step 2 - Edit my.cnf file

%p
  Once connected, you need to edit the MySQL server configuration file <b>my.cnf</b> using a text editor such as <b>vi</b> or <b>nano</b>.

%p
  Usually this file is located at <b>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</b>, if you're using a <b>Debian</b> based distribution, such as <b>Debian</b> or <b>Ubuntu</b>.

%p
  Other distros keep the file in <b>/etc/my.cnf</b>, so if you can't find it on the path above, check this path as well.

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      root@server:/etc/mysql# vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

%h4 Step 3 - Bind and allow remote connection

%p
  First, run this command to get your IP address (if you don't know it already):

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      root@server:/etc/mysql# ifconfig
      eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:16:3e:4b:e6:4e  
                inet addr:73.246.40.253  Bcast:73.246.40.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
                inet6 addr: 2607:f3c8:3801:2:216:3eff:fe4b:e64e/64 Scope:Global
                inet6 addr: fe80::216:3eff:fe4b:e64e/64 Scope:Link
                UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
                RX packets:14037391 errors:0 dropped:22281 overruns:0 frame:0
                TX packets:380195 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
                collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
                RX bytes:1313512656 (1.3 GB)  TX bytes:61077910 (61.0 MB)
                Interrupt:19 

      lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
                inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
                inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
                UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
                RX packets:3 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
                TX packets:3 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
                collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
                RX bytes:340 (340.0 B)  TX bytes:340 (340.0 B)

%p
  Your IP is the <b>inet addr:</b> for eth0, or <b>73.246.40.253</b> in this case.

%p
  Now change the following line:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      bind-address=127.0.0.1

%p
  To match your IP address:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      bind-address=73.246.40.253

%p
  And save the file. Make sure you don't have a line with <b>skip-networking</b>. If you do, comment it out by prefixing the line with a <code>#</code>.

%p
  Now, restart the mysql server, enter:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      root@server:/etc/mysql# service mysql restart
      mysql start/running, process 14456

%p
  If <b>service mysql restart</b> doesn't work, try <b>/etc/init.d/mysql restart</b>.

%h4 Step 3 - Grant access to remote IP address

%p
  Connect to MySQL server:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      root@server:/etc/mysql# mysql -u root -p mysql

%p
  And grant access to a new database

%p
  If you want to add a new database called foo for user bar and remote IP 202.54.10.20 then you need to type the following commands at <b>mysql></b> prompt:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      mysql> GRANT ALL ON foo.* TO bar@'202.54.10.20' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';

%p
  Just make sure you change:
  %ul
    %li <b>foo</b> with the database;
    %li <b>bar</b> with the database user name;
    %li <b>202.54.10.20</b> with your Webby's IP;
    %li <b>PASSWORD</b> with the database password;
    

%h4 Step 5 - Logout of MySQL

%p
  Type exit command to logout mysql:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      mysql> exit

%h4 Step 6 - Open port 3306 (optional)

%p
  You need to open TCP port 3306 using ufw (if you're not using or using a different firewall solution, like iptables, you should open port 3306). 

%p
  If you want to open to a given IP only:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      ufw allow proto tcp from 202.54.10.20 to any port 3306
      
%p
  Or if you want to open it to all IPs in a subnet:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      ufw allow proto tcp from 201.82.56.0/24 to any port 3306

%p
  Or if you want to open it to any IPs:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      ufw allow 3306

%h4 Step 7 - Test it

%p
  From your remote system or your desktop type the following command:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      $ mysql -u user –h 65.55.55.2 –pPASSWORD

%p
  Where:

%ul
  %li <b>-u user</b>: in this case, <b>user</b> is the MySQL user name
  %li <b>-h 65.55.55.2</b>: <b>65.55.55.2</b> is MySQL server IP address or hostname (FQDN)
  %li <b>-pPASSWORD</b>: Uses PASSWORD as the user password. If you leave PASSWORD empty, it will prompt for a password.

%p
  You can also use telnet to connect to port 3306 for testing purpose:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      $ telnet 65.55.55.2 3306
