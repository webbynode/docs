%p
  For applications that uses subdomains, a wildcard domain may be necessary. To use a 
  wildcard DNS with Webbynode gem, just change the DNS using <b>*.yourdomain.com</b>:

  %code
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ wn change_dns \*.rubyista.com
        [Webbynode] Changing DNS to *.rubyista.com...
        Creating DNS entry for *.rubyista.com...
        Your application will start responding to 
        *.rubyista.com after next deployment.

  Next time you push your app you will note the following output:

  %code
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ wn push

        (...)

  After that, your application will start responding to anything that ends with the domain you 
  specified, in this case <b>rubyista.com</b>.
