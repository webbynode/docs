%h2 Validations

%p
  Validations are very similar to Requirements, with one difference:
  they are executed after the executions are finished successfully.
  
%p
  The main responsibility of validations are to make sure the environment
  after the installation matches what is expected. If this check fails,
  the deployment will be considered to be a failure and the user will
  be notified so he can take proper action.

%p
  The validations descriptor file has the following format:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      --- 
      validations: 
      - data: /usr/bin/my_new_program
        type: ExecutableExists
      - data: /etc/data/my_new_program_data.dat
        type: FileExists

%p
  Like validations, each entry has a `type` and `data` field.
