%h2 Dump

%p
  Dumping a script will download it from the website to your local file system
  in a way that you can make changes and republish it afterwards.
  
%p
  You can clone your own scripts but also other user's public scripts,
  which gives you the ability to "clone" other scripts, make your changes,
  and publish them live.

%p
  The dump command is quite simple. When you give it just a script name,
  it will dump a script under your account:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      $ stackfu dump ubuntu_firewall
        create  ubuntu_firewall/
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/script.yml
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/config/
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/config/01-controls.yml
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/config/02-requirements.yml
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/config/03-executions.yml
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/config/04-validations.yml
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/executables/
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/executables/install_ufw.sh.erb
      	create  ubuntu_firewall/executables/configure_ufw.sh.erb
      Success: Script ubuntu_firewall dumped.

%p
  You can also use the format <code>user/script</code> to dump another
  user's script:
  
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      $ stackfu dump ctaborda/ssh_change_port
        create  ssh_change_port/
      	create  ssh_change_port/script.yml
      	create  ssh_change_port/config/
      	create  ssh_change_port/config/01-controls.yml
      	create  ssh_change_port/config/02-requirements.yml
      	create  ssh_change_port/config/03-executions.yml
      	create  ssh_change_port/config/04-validations.yml
      	create  ssh_change_port/executables/
      	create  ssh_change_port/executables/change_ssh_port.sh.erb
      Success: Script ctaborda/ssh_change_port dumped.
      
In this case I dumped ctaborda's script called <code>change_ssh_port</code>.
