%h2 S3 Backup

%p
  Rapid App Deployment allows you to enable daily backups to an Amazon S3 account, 
  for any of your apps using the <b>add_backup</b> command.
  
%p
  The backup will be transferred to a bucket with the prefix <b>webbynode_backup_</b>,
  followed by the hostname of your Webby. If it's called webby1234, the bucket will be
  <b>webbynode_backup_webby1234</b>. Inside this bucket, the following folder structure
  will be created:
  
%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      webbynode_backup_webby1234
      `- backup
           `- your_app_name
                |- archive
                `- mysqldump / pgdump
  
  
%p
  The <b>archive</b> folder contains a backup of the source code of your app, while
  the <b>mysqldump</b> or <b>pgdump</b> folder contains a dump of your database.

      Webbynode Rapid App Backup

      This service will backup a dump of your application Database and 
      the contents of your application folder to a bucket on Amazon S3.

      create one, please check our guide on

      DISCLAIMER: Backing up to S3 will incur on a charge by Amazon 
      according to the terms of the services contract you accepted 
      when signing up to their services. We do not guarantee the minimum
      or maximum size of the backup, depending completely on how large 
      is the data your application produces. By entering your credentials

      [Webbynode] Configuring backup for sampleapp...
      Adding backup for sampleapp
        => Configuring backup script with 30 days retention...
        => Setting up a daily cron job...
        => Executing first backup...

        => Done!

%p
  Once you finish entering your data, a first backup is executed and a cronjob is executed, 
  so that every night a new backup will be transferred to your S3 account. We'll store 30 
  days of history by default but that can be overridden.

%h3 Changing the backup retention

  In order to change the backup retention days, just use the <code>--retain</code> option, like below:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      $ wn add_backup --retain=15
