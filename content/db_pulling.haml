%h3 Database Pull

.note
  %b IMPORTANT:
  %br
  Database pull and push is in beta and at this time we only support
  MySQL databases.

%p
  If you have a remote database in your Webby and you want to transfer this
  data to your local environment, you can use the <b>database pull</b> command.

%p
  In this case, here's the remote data we want to transfer, and 
  current data in our local app:

%p.center
  <img src="/images/database/local-before-pull.png">

%p.center
  <img src="/images/database/remote-database.png">

%p
  Then we execute the <b>pull</b> command:

%code
  %pre
    :preserve
      $ wn db pull        
      Pulling remote data to database screencast
      Receiving schema
      Schema:        100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:02
      Receiving data
      2 tables, 400 records
      schema_migrat: 100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00

      schema_migrat: 100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00
      Resetting sequences

      Stopping taps server...

  And the database after the <b>pull</b> is finished:
