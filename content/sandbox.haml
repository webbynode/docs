%h2 What is a Sandbox?

%p
  So you created an amazing script but how will you test it? You obviously don't
  want to mess up a live server only to test your scripts and you will need to
  install it a couple of times until it's perfect right?
  
%p
  That's where a sandbox server can be useful. We'll create a Virtual Machine in
  your local machine that is completely disposable. This way you can install your
  script over and over, until it's perfect for mass consumption.
  
%h3 Meet Vagrant
  
%p{ :align => 'center' }
  %table{ :align => 'center'}
    %tr
      %td{ :align => 'right' }
        %img{ :src => '/images/vagrant_chilling.png' }
      %td
        %img{ :src => '/images/vagrant-logo.png' }

%p
  For this task, we'll use an amazing tool, called #{link 'Vagrant', 'http://vagrantup.com/'}, 
  that can help us running a virtualized VirtualBox environment locally, so we can play with
  our scripts.

  But first, let's #{link 'create a new server', '/creating_the_server/'} in StackFu.
