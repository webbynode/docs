%h2 Publishing

%p
  To publish your application to the Webby you configured during
  the <a href="/bootstrapping/">bootstrapping</a>, you just need
  to use the <b>wn push</b> command.

%p
  Here's a sample output of the command:
  

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      $ wn push

%p
  Depending on the engine used, many tasks are executed while your
  application is pushed to the server.
  
%p
  The common part is creating a vhost entry for you webserver and
  pointing it to the deployment folder.
  
%p
  In more complex engines, like Rails, tasks like creating a database
  user, a new database, database.yml, bundling or gems installation,
  database migration, among others will occur after the push.

  %b IMPORTANT:
  When pushing an application for the first time to your Webby, 
  ssh login for the root user will be disabled.
  To understand the reasons behind this, and how to override this
  behavior if you want, check the <a href="/security/">security</a>
  section.
