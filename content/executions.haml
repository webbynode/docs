%h2 Executions

%p
  This is the meat of the script, where things actually happen. After checking
  for requirements, the installation takes place.
  
%p
  In this phase, all the shell scripts described in the <code>03-executions.yml</code>
  file will execute on the server.

%p  
  The scripts executed are always executed in the order they appear in the YAML file,
  top to bottom.
  
%p
  Each script can mix bash code and ruby, since they are ERB files. The scripts are 
  always first preprocessed in StackFu and then executed. So a script like this:
  
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ufw default deny
      &lt;% ports.split(",").each do |port| %>
        echo "Allowing port &lt;%= port %>"
        ufw allow &lt;%= port %> 
      &lt;% end %>
      yes | ufw enable
  
%p
  When the user provides "22,23,25,80,8080", for instance, will first be transformed into
  this shell script:
  
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ufw default deny
        echo "Allowing port 22"
        ufw allow 22
        echo "Allowing port 23"
        ufw allow 23
        echo "Allowing port 25"
        ufw allow 24
        echo "Allowing port 80"
        ufw allow 80
        echo "Allowing port 8080"
        ufw allow 8080
      yes | ufw enable

And then executed on the server.
  
%h2 Special variable <code>env_ip</code>

%p
  When the server first checks in with StackFu, we gather its public IP and save it
  in our database. This information is useful when installing scripts, so it is provided
  and can be used like it were a user provided variable.

%p
  Let's imagine you need to configure a PHP application that has a <code>config.php</code>
  file, that is usually something that the user would do interactively. You can do it easily,
  even if your virtual host is only bound to your external IP, using the <code>env_ip</code>
  variable:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      # some setup
      cd /tmp
      wget http://hugephpsocialapp.com/latest.tar.gz
      tar vzxf latest.tar.gz
      cd latest
      # (...)
      
      # calls this server's config.php
      curl -L http://&lt;%= env_ip %>/config.php
        -F "password=&lt;%= password %>" 
        -F "database=&lt;%= database %>"
